# Building from separate directory:
# ccmake /path/to/AstroViz/src
# fill in ParaView dir to be /Path/To/ParaView/Built/From/Source
# configure (c) until generate (g) option is available, generate, then type make from command line

# Creating an Xcode Project for easy development on MacOSX (from separate directory)
# ccmake -G Xcode /path/to/AstroViz/src
# fill in ParaView dir to be /Path/To/ParaView/Built/From/Source
# configure (c) until generate (g) option is available, generate, then open Project.xcodeproj.  This will build
# NOTE: if you change Cmakelists.txt you should go through this whole procedure again to regenerate a project, otherwise your changes will not propogate.
